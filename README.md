## 🚀 Key Features

* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Comprehensive data visualization using `Seaborn` and `Matplotlib` to identify correlations between features like Age, BMI, Smoking status, and the final charges.
* **Data Preprocessing:** * Handling categorical variables through encoding.
    * Feature scaling and data cleaning.
    * Splitting the dataset into Training and Testing sets (80/20).
* **Machine Learning Modeling:** * Implementation of the **XGBoost Regressor** algorithm.
    * Hyperparameter tuning (n_estimators, learning_rate, max_depth) for optimal performance.
* **Evaluation Metrics:**
    * **R2 Score:** 90.32% (Demonstrating high predictive accuracy).
    * **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** 2469.76.
* **Model Deployment:** The final trained model is serialized into a `.pkl` file using `Pickle` for seamless integration into production environments.
